**🔐 Caesar Cipher – Python Implementation**

**📌 Internship Task – Cybersecurity**

_Task Name: Implement Caesar Cipher_

_Task Number: Task-01_

---

🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?
---

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques used in cryptography. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message is replaced by another letter after shifting it by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

**Example**:

 Message: HELLO
 
 Shift: 3
 
 Encrypted: KHOOR


**📖 Description**

This project implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using Python. The program allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform secure text transformation. It handles uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving spaces and special characters.

🎯 Objective
--

> To understand basic cryptographic techniques

> To implement encryption and decryption

> To learn character manipulation using ASCII values

> To apply cybersecurity fundamentals in Python

---

🛠️ Technologies Used
--
Programming Language: Python

Concepts: Cryptography, Caesar Cipher, ASCII values

---

⚙️ Features
--

- Encrypts text using a shift key

- Decrypts encrypted text

- Preserves:

> Uppercase & lowercase letters

> Spaces & special characters

> User-friendly input and output
---

🧑‍💻 How It Works
--

- User enters a message

- User provides a shift value

- User selects:

> E → Encryption

> D → Decryption

**The program shifts characters accordingly and displays the result**
